# Hydro-elastic Model for Bandgap Analysis

This repository contains the MATLAB source code for the bandgap analysis of hydro-elastic models, as presented in our research paper.

## Description

The code implements the finite element method (FEM) to calculate and analyze the bandgap of hydro-elastic models under specific conditions. By running the provided scripts, users can reproduce the key findings and figures presented in our study.
